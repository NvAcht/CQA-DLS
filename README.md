# Scripts required for continuous quality assurance of deep learning segmentaions in radiotherapy.

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts used in "Results of continuous quality assurance for deep learning segmentations in radiotherapy making use of statistical process control for automatic performance monitoring" by Van Acht et al. 
These scripts cover a variety of tasks.

## üìÇ Scripts

| File Name       | Description                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `CQA_DLS_GUI.py`   | GUI that lets you score data, create plots, make datasheets and detect outliers and trend shifts.|
| `GUI_functions.py`    | Functions required for all functionalities in the GUI            |
| `calculator_functions.py`      | Functions required to get scores from RTstruct.dcm files, integrated in GUI   |
| `SPC_control_limits.py` | Script that determines the control limits based on SPC. Required to perfrom automatic monitoring, not for visualisation in GUI | 


## üíª Requirements

- Python 3.8.7
- The following Python packages (exact versions recommended):
  - Numpy 1.23.5
  - Scipy 1.10.1
  - Matplotlib 3.7.5
  - Pydicom 2.4.4
  - surface_distance 0.1

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project was developed and tested with **Python 3.8.7**. Using other versions might work but is not guaranteed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Although this code is written to work for other institute than the development institute, this still requires some tailoring of the data setup and tailoring of the code.

### Data

The clinical segmentations (CS) and deep learning segmentatation (DLS) RTstruct DICOM files need to be exported from a treatment planning stystem to a local drive which you can access from your preferred code editor. Also the file names of these RTStruct.dcm files needs to be very specific. In the institute where this code is developed it was chosen to do type%pid%CTid%date%time%protocol.dcm. This would result in a pair of CS - DLS DICOM files that can be linked to one another. In the code (calculator_functions.py) this can be found in the get_scores function. Here it can be seen that AS (auto-segmentation and thus DLS) and MS (manual segmentation and thus CS) files are linked within the patient folder. As example a CS RTStruct.dcm file is named: AS%1234567890%1.2.34.5.6.7.8.9.1233456789%20240101%090000.dcm. The corresponding DLS RTstruct.dcm file is named: MS%1234567890%1.2.34.5.6.7.8.9.1233456789%20240101%090000.dcm. You can change the AS and MS to DLS and CS respectively for consistency. If you do this, also change it in calculator_functions.py.

These DICOM files are saved on data folder. This data folder has a very specific setup. In the parent data folder there will be folders for every day an DLS RTStruct is saved, a day folder. In this day folder there will be folders for every patient that had a DLS RTStruct saved that day, a patient folder. In this patient folder the RTStruct DICOM is saved. Later when the CS RTStruct DICOM is saved, it should be saved in this same patient folder. Eventually the scores.npy file will also be saved in this patient folder. Considering the same examples as above, the path to the folder will be "path to parent data folder"\20240101\1234567890\. In here will be three files:
-  AS%1234567890%1.2.34.5.6.7.8.9.1233456789%20240101%090000.dcm (or DLS%1234567890%1.2.34.5.6.7.8.9.1233456789%20240101%090000.dcm if you want to change up the name)
-  MS%1234567890%1.2.34.5.6.7.8.9.1233456789%20240101%090000.dcm (or CS%1234567890%1.2.34.5.6.7.8.9.1233456789%20240101%090000.dcm if you want to change up the name)
-  scores_1234567890_1.2.34.5.6.7.8.9.1233456789.npy (CT id is mentioned as it can occurr that multiple RTStrutcs are exported based on different CTs)
